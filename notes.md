This app is a culmination of 2 years at Flatiron school.  I have combined my knowledge, skills and 
ability to find knowledge and skills online to make this app.  It is in its most basic form but the 
road to get there was long and bumpy.  I plan to use this app to show that I understand the concepts
necessary to create a rails backend API and a react/javascript frontend.

At the start of my coding journey I knew almost nothing about the skills necessary to create a working
app that could store and show data that a user had submitted.  This task is much more difficult than
one would think!  The basic principle of using a mouse to click on a particular button and then communicate
that data to mulitiple files of code that then makes multiple decisions behind the scenes to CRUD was 
basically unknown to me.  I have come a long way and I hope to show that I am ready to move into the world
of a professional designer/programmer!
